## Installation
Read Me generator utilizes NPM and the inquirer package. In my code repository I have included a package.json file. Once you have cloned the code you can run {npm install -y} this will download all neccessary packages needed for the application.

## Usage
After the appropriate packages have been installed highlighted above. You will run a node terminal command {node index.js} This will initialize the application and the user will be prompted to answer questions in the terminal about their application. Upon completion of the questions a README.md file will be generated and can be copied to any application of their choosing.

license information at this point is option. You can leave the fields regarding that information blank. Future development includes being able to dynamically update the entire README.md allowing all fields to be optional allowing for a more customizable experience.

This Readme was  generated using the application however some fields were ommitted of this use case.You can view a full sample generated using this Application in my repository name "SAMPLEREADME.MD
